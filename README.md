# Airline Boarding and Tracking System

This is a **C++ project** that simulates a simple airline boarding and passenger tracking system.  
The project was built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and inheritance**.  

No database or external library was used — everything is implemented with **basic C++ only**.

## Features
- **Passenger Management** – store passenger details (name, age, passport, etc.).
- **Flight Management** – basic flight info handling.
- **Economy & Business Classes** – demonstrates inheritance and class specialization.
- **Business Class Extras**:
  - Lounge access
  - Priority boarding
  - Extra baggage fare calculation
- **Boarding Simulation** – shows when passengers are checked in and boarded.

## Technologies Used
- Language: **C++**
- Paradigm: **Object-Oriented Programming**
- No DBMS used  
- No external frameworks/libraries
